## Career

### Prequel (2021 - Now)
I currently work as RnD Deep Learning Engineer at [Prequel Inc.](https://prequel.app). Here I am developing deep learning algorithms for various computer vision tasks.

### Sberbank (2018 - 2021)
I worked as a Data Scientist at Sberbank. I’ve managed to work with several teams of the Corporate Investment Banking Unit, solving tasks of lead generation, demand forecasting, data analytics, automated document analysis. My key contributions are:

- Created and automated analytical dashboards of corporate chats
- Created an [open-source fork](https://github.com/kovalexal/tomita-parser-spark) of [tomita-parser](https://yandex.ru/dev/tomita/) - the tool for automatic extraction of structured facts from text, which now works over Apache Spark framework. I also used it to automate the extraction of corporate customers rent objects
- Developed and implemented machine learning models for prediction of clients needs in several categories (realty, transport, equipment, machinery)
- Modified existing rotation classifier of image documents
- Deployed mlflow instance for tracking and storing ML experiments and their artifacts
- Created own OCR engine: used distillation to speed up existing CRAFT model (2x speedup), trained own CRNN network for Russian language (EfficientNet-B0 was used as a backbone)

### Moscow State University (2015 - 2018)
I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at MSU (R&D laboratory, behavioral biometrics). My key contributions were:

- Created pipeline for conducting machine learning experiments
- Implemented new method for selection of features with special structure
- Participated in the development of instruments for data acquisition and analysis
- Scientific paper publication and participation in a conference as a speaker

I also took part in the implementation of a Data Storage System for «RSC Energia» as a C# developer, where I was responsible for development stand creation and support, implementation of a cluster service, which performed communication with long-term storage (of tape type).

### Scientific Research Institute for System Analysis of the Russian Academy of Sciences (2014 - 2017)
I worked as a Software Engineer at SRISA RAS. Here I participated in the development of parallel data analysis methods, with the following key contributions:

- Implemented K-d trees data structure in Fortran for its further integration into an existing code base
- Created parallel implementation of the PAM clustering algorithm in C++ using Boost.MPI and profiled it on "Lomonosov" supercomputer
